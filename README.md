# Eccentricity-Visualizer

This application allows you to visualize the mathematical concept of eccentricity. To use it, move around the stage's focus point or, in the top bar, change and animate the eccentricity to see how the produced locus of points is affected.

You can run the program by downloading and opening Eccentricity Visualizer.swf.
